Iâ€™m Bethany Astor, an MSc Statistics student at Imperial College London. I graduated with a joint degree in Mathematics and Medieval History from the University of St Andrews then I began my masterâ€™s-level education in statistics at Duke University in North Carolina before returning to the UK.

Iâ€™m passionate about applying technical statistical models to real-world data and turning those findings into practical solutions to complex problems. Having enjoyed my time in a summer institute in biostatistics, I have an interest in biostats and healthcare, but I am still excited to see statistics and data science applied to a variety of fields.
